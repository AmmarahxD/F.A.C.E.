# F.A.C.E.
 In this project, we aim to identify and classify images provided as input into two main categories, adults and minors. This classification would act as an access controller to the desired resources or information. The identification of younger image and older image are focused on the methods using MATLAB. First we extract certain features from the input Face images, later using different method like feature extraction and wrinkle analysis thus getting related databases. Later stages include, comparing several trained databases, to get a specific range for younger images and older images. This range then acts as a basis for identifying the young and old face.
